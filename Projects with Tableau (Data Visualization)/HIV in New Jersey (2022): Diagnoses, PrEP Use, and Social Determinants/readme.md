# HIV in New Jersey (2022): Diagnoses, PrEP Use, and Social Determinants

Overview: This is an interactive dashboard created with Tableau that explores HIV diagnoses and prevention indicators in New Jersey using 2022 data. The dashboard visualizes county-level trends and patterns in new HIV diagnoses, Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) use, and the PrEP-to-Need ratio, alongside selected social determinants of health (SDOH) indicators. The aim of this project is to visually describe and compare variations in HIV diagnoses, PrEP use, and related social indicators across New Jersey counties using publicly available data.

The dashboard includes a county-level choropleth map of HIV new diagnosis rates in New Jersey, demographic breakdowns of new HIV diagnoses by gender and race/ethnicity, bar charts showing PrEP use rates by county and PrEP-to-Need ratios by county, and selected social determinants of health.

Data Source: All data used in this project are publicly available and were obtained from AIDSVu. The 2022 county-level datasets were used to visualize indicators, including HIV new diagnoses, PrEP use, PrEP-to-Need ratio, and social determinants of health indicators. The AIDSVu datasets were originally provided as separate files by indicator. For the purpose of this project, a curated dataset was created by limiting all data to New Jersey and its counties and selecting relevant indicators from each separate dataset. 

This project is intended to demonstrate data visualization skills using Tableau and to conduct a descriptive exploration of public health surveillance data relevant for informing public health planning.
