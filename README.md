# Data-Analysis-Projects

This repository includes data analysis projects I worked on during my graduate program in public health. Most of these projects were completed for coursework, along with a few personal projects I worked on independently. These are uploaded here to showcase my skills and experience with data cleaning, data management, and data analysis.

All projects focus on public health topics and mostly use publicly available datasets such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). The analyses were conducted using R, Python, and SAS.
